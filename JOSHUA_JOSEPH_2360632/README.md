Aim:

To construct a simple Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer and demonstrate how the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
resolves IPv4 addresses into MAC addresses by capturing and analyzing ARP request and ARP reply packets.

Result

A LAN was successfully created using three PCs and a switch in Cisco Packet Tracer.
When PC1 pinged PC3, the simulation showed ARP Requests and ARP Replies being exchanged,
followed by successful ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets. This confirms that ARP 
correctly resolved the IP address of PC3 into its MAC address, enabling smooth communication within the LAN.
